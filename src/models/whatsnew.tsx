    title: <span>Add Reuse Logic feature</span>,
    body: (
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you have multiple exercises in a program that share the same logic for sets, reps and weight, and also
          logic for updating those, you now can "reuse logic" from other exercises. This way you can avoid repeating the
          same logic over and over again, and you'll have a single source of truth for that logic (in the exercise you
          reuse).
        </li>
        <li>
          It should be useful for most programs, since usually they have multiple exercises following the same
          progression/deload pattern.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each exercise still has its own state variables values, but it must have the same variable names and types.

        <li>
          Added Program Preview, that shows the high-level overview of a program. It lists all the days and exercises,
          all the sets variations (sets/reps/weight), you could see the formulas/scripts for each exercise, and muscles
          for each day and the whole program. You can use it for 2 cases:
          <ul className="pl-4 list-disc">
            <li>
              When you pick a built-in program, there's a "Preview" button in the modal with the program info. So you
              could see now what you sign up for.
            </li>
            <li>
              When you build your own program, there's "Preview" footer button. If will give you high-level overview of
              the program, and could help to make sure everything works right there.

    title: <span>Exercise Stats</span>,
    body: (
      <ul>
        <li>
          Added Exercise Stats - a new screen that shows various statistics for an exercise. It shows the graph, the
          personal records, the history of the exercise. You can switch between different exercises right on that
          screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          The entrypoint to that screen is from the workout screen - when you tap on the exercise name, exercise image,
          or when you open the bottom sheet - there's an option "Exercise Stats"

    title: <span>Footer navigation</span>,
    body: (
      <ul>
        <li>
          We've got complains that the footer navigation is confusing. And indeed, the left part was different from
          screen to screen, and it sometimes was hard to understand where are you.
        </li>
        <li>
          So, now the footer nav is always the same across all screens. The screen-based buttons got moved to either
          3-dot menu in the navbar, or to regular buttons right on the screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          Also, had to move the rest timer from the footer, now it's a floating timer, that is visible on all screens.
          If you tap on it, you will go to the currently ongoing workout.

    title: <span>Choose Programs screen redesign</span>,

        <li>
          Now it shows all the exercise images a built-in program contains, as well as the required equipment and
          approximate time to finish a workout from the program. Hopefully it'll help with choosing the right program.

    title: <span>Web Editor for programs</span>,
    body: (
      <ul>
        <li>
          There's a new web editor for programs, so you could edit the programs from a laptop -{" "}
          <InternalLink className="font-bold underline text-bluev2" href="/program">
            liftosaur.com/program
          </InternalLink>
          . You can create a program there, then copy the link, and paste it into the app (on the program selection
          screen). You can also generate a link for any of your programs (on the program edit screen), and open in the
          web editor, edit there, copy link again, and paste it into the app to import the changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Those links are immutable - any change in the program would change the link. You can share those links if you
          want to share your program with somebody else, and they'll be able to import the program into their app.
        </li>

    title: <span>Inspirations in the Advanced Edit Mode</span>,
    body: (
      <ul>
        <li>
          Now in the "Advanced" mode of the exercise editor (both on a phone and in the web editor), there's a link at
          the top that opens a modal with various examples of the reps/weight and finish day scripts.
        </li>
        <li>
          You could use it for "inspiration", to reuse some of the recipes, or come up with your own based on those. Or
          just to see what you can do with <strong>Liftoscript</strong>.

    title: <span>Notes</span>,
    body: (
      <ul>
        <li>
          Added ability to add notes to the overall workouts and specific exercises during workout. You can then see
          those notes on the History screen, on the exercise details screen, and also on the Graphs.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can also filter the history on the exercise details screen by whether the history record had notes for
          that exercise.
        </li>

  "20230318": {
    title: <span>Per Exercise Rest Timers</span>,
    body: (
      <ul>
        <li>
          Now you can specify custom exercise rest timers. By default it still would use your workout timer from
          Settings, but you can override it for some exercises. So now you can have different rest timers for Deadlift
          and Bicep Curls!
        </li>
        <li>
          You specify timer as a Liftoscript expression, similar to reps and weight, so you can define logic there too,
          and use state variables.
        </li>
      </ul>
