          Shows how much specific muscles used in the current program. You may use it to find inbalances in your
          program. We calculate usage for <strong>strength</strong> and <strong>hypertrophy</strong> separately. For{" "}
          <strong>strength</strong> we consider sets with reps &lt; 8, for <strong>hypertrophy</strong> - sets with reps
          &gt;= 8. For calculating percentages, we assume each target muscle is 3x of each synergist muscle, we combine
          all sets and reps, and then normalize by the most used muscle - it will be 100%.
